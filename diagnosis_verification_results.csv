Therefore, the symptoms highly suggest GBS, which is the condition the doctor is implicitly considering for diagnosis (as indicated by 'since it can sometimes lead to gbs').

However, the diagnostic and therapeutic plan outlined by the doctor contains several inappropriate and missing elements for GBS:
- **Irrelevant tests:** Urinalysis, HPV DNA detection, Echocardiography, and Chlamydia tests are not standard or primary diagnostic investigations for GBS. While some infections can trigger GBS, HPV and Chlamydia are not common or primary associations that warrant routine testing in this context, and echocardiography is unrelated to GBS diagnosis.
- **Suboptimal imaging:** While MRI can sometimes show nerve root enhancement in GBS, it is not as definitive as Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) and Electromyography (EMG).
- **Missing key diagnostics:** Crucially, the doctor's plan omits essential diagnostic tests such as Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) and Electromyography (EMG), which are vital for confirming GBS by detecting demyelination or axonal damage. It also omits a lumbar puncture for Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis, which typically shows albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein with normal cell count) in GBS.
- **Appropriate therapy:** Physical therapy is an appropriate part of recovery and rehabilitation for GBS but is not a diagnostic procedure.

While hyperopia (farsightedness) can cause these symptoms, presbyopia is a more direct and common diagnosis for this specific presentation, particularly as an age-related condition involving the hardening of the eye's lens and loss of accommodative power. Furthermore, the extensive list of medications prescribed (tropicamide ophthalmic, phenylephrine duramax, cyclopentolate ophthalmic, atropine uaa, proparacaine ophthalmic, fluorescein, nepafenac ophthalmic, dexamethasonetobramycin ophthalmic, cyclopentolatephenylephrine ophthalmic, azelastine ophthalmic, fluorometholone ophthalmic, and benzylpenicilloyl polylysine prepen) is entirely inappropriate for treating either hyperopia or presbyopia. These drugs are a mix of diagnostic agents, pupil dilators, anesthetics, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, and an allergy test, none of which are standard treatments for refractive errors.

Overflow incontinence, however, is characterized by involuntary leakage due to an overfull bladder caused by either bladder outlet obstruction or an underactive detrusor muscle leading to incomplete emptying. Prescribing solifenacin for overflow incontinence is generally contraindicated because it can further suppress detrusor contractility, worsening urinary retention and exacerbating the overflow incontinence. The treatment for overflow incontinence focuses on addressing the underlying cause of obstruction or improving bladder emptying, not reducing bladder contractility.",Overflow Incontinence

The doctor's response, 'yes we need to give you some medications for that you will need thiopental nitrous oxide iodine topical and sevoflurane', is not a diagnosis of a medical condition but rather a list of medications. These medications (thiopental, nitrous oxide, sevoflurane for general anesthesia, and iodine topical for antiseptic preparation) are components of a *treatment plan* for a surgical procedure, typically required for certain types of fractures.

Therefore, the doctor's identification of WKS as a likely diagnosis based on these symptoms is plausible. However, it is imperative to note that while thiamine is the correct and primary treatment for WKS, the extensive list of additional medications proposed is largely inappropriate, excessive, and potentially harmful for the direct treatment of this syndrome. The inclusion of various antidepressants (bupropion, venlafaxine, trazodone), antipsychotics (quetiapine), anxiolytics/sedatives (clonazepam, chlordiazepoxide), an antiplatelet agent (abciximab), an alcohol dependence medication (acamprosate), an anticonvulsant (primidone), and sodium bicarbonate indicates a significant misunderstanding of WKS pathophysiology and its management.

Ursodiol is used for cholestatic liver diseases but is not a primary treatment for acute AFLP. Glyburide, an oral hypoglycemic agent for Type 2 Diabetes, is contraindicated as AFLP often presents with severe hypoglycemia, and its administration would dangerously worsen this condition. Methadone (an opioid) and mecamylamine (a rarely used ganglionic blocker for hypertension) are completely irrelevant to AFLP treatment. Famotidine (an H2 blocker) is a minor supportive drug at best.

HG is a severe form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, often leading to dehydration, weight loss, and significant impairment of daily activities. The doctor's primary diagnosis directly aligns with these core symptoms. While the doctor's comprehensive treatment plan includes medications for potential co-existing conditions, complications, or differential diagnoses (e.g., propylthiouracil/methyldopa for thyroid issues, miconazole for skin irritation, nitrofurantoin for infection), these considerations do not invalidate the primary diagnosis of HG for the presented symptoms. Rather, they reflect a thorough clinical approach to managing a complex case of severe N&V in pregnancy where other conditions might contribute or arise.

RLS is primarily characterized by an irresistible urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable sensations, which are typically worse during periods of rest or inactivity and partially or totally relieved by movement. While the doctor's follow-up questions successfully elicited classic RLS symptoms (restlessness in legs when lying down or sitting for long periods, moving legs around a lot), the initial patient complaint of 'back pain' itself does not highly suggest this diagnosis.","Acute Musculoskeletal Back Pain (e.g., muscle strain or sprain)"
doctor i have been experiencing cramps and spasms as well as lower abdominal pain,based on your symptoms it appears that you may have undergone an induced abortion recently it is important to disclose any recent medical procedures to your healthcare provider in order to receive proper care have you recently undergone an abortion,0.2605539560317993,False,False,"The symptoms of 'cramps and spasms as well as lower abdominal pain' are highly non-specific and can be attributed to numerous conditions, including gynecological (e.g., dysmenorrhea, ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage), gastrointestinal (e.g., gastroenteritis, IBS), or urological issues (e.g., UTI). While an induced abortion can certainly present with these symptoms, these symptoms alone do not 'highly suggest' it over many other more common possibilities without additional context, such as a missed period, positive pregnancy test, or a patient's disclosure of a recent procedure. The doctor's diagnosis appears to be a speculative jump without sufficient supporting evidence from the provided symptoms.",Dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps)

This directly indicates the use of a substance (alcohol) in a potentially problematic way to cope with a mental health symptom (insomnia). The diagnosis of a 'substance-related mental disorder' is an appropriate umbrella term covering both substance use disorders (e.g., Alcohol Use Disorder) and substance-induced mental disorders (e.g., Alcohol-Induced Sleep Disorder), both of which are strongly suggested by the patient's description.",substancerelated mental disorder
doctor i have been having nosebleeds muscle swelling loss of sensation and nausea what could be causing this,these symptoms are indicative of a pituitary adenoma its a noncancerous tumor in the pituitary gland that causes hormonal imbalances and can lead to various symptoms including the ones you have mentioned we need to conduct some tests to confirm the diagnosis,0.2819129824638366,False,False,"The symptoms provided – nosebleeds, muscle swelling, loss of sensation, and nausea – do not strongly align with the typical presentation of a pituitary adenoma. Pituitary adenomas commonly cause symptoms related to hormonal imbalances (e.g., galactorrhea, amenorrhea, acromegaly, Cushing's syndrome) or mass effect (e.g., headaches, visual field defects like bitemporal hemianopsia). While acromegaly can lead to soft tissue swelling and headaches might cause nausea in severe cases, nosebleeds and significant 'loss of sensation' (suggesting neuropathy) are not characteristic primary symptoms of pituitary adenomas. A diagnosis like Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA), a systemic vasculitis, better explains this constellation of symptoms, as it can cause upper respiratory tract involvement (leading to nosebleeds), myalgia/muscle inflammation, peripheral neuropathy (causing loss of sensation), and general constitutional symptoms including nausea.",Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)

The combination of redness, swelling, and particularly intense itchiness is highly indicative of allergic conjunctivitis, where an immune response to an allergen causes inflammation of the conjunctiva, leading to these classic symptoms.",Allergic Conjunctivitis
doctor i have been experiencing knee swelling lower abdominal pain and skin swelling what could be the cause of this,based on your symptoms you might be suffering from ovarian torsion have you experienced any other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting,0.149315595626831,False,False,"Ovarian torsion is primarily characterized by sudden, severe, unilateral lower abdominal pain, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The patient's reported symptoms of knee swelling and generalized skin swelling are not typical manifestations of ovarian torsion. In contrast, hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a condition known for recurrent episodes of skin swelling (angioedema) and abdominal pain due to edema of the intestinal wall. While knee swelling is less commonly highlighted, joint swelling can occur during HAE attacks, making it a more comprehensive explanation for all three reported symptoms than ovarian torsion.",Hereditary Angioedema
doctor i have been experiencing sharp abdominal pain recently,based on your symptoms it seems like you may be suffering from a vaginal yeast infection,0.2241055965423584,False,False,"Sharp abdominal pain is a non-specific symptom that can indicate a wide range of conditions affecting the gastrointestinal, urinary, or reproductive systems, among others. A vaginal yeast infection (candidiasis) primarily presents with symptoms such as vaginal itching, burning, abnormal discharge (often thick, white, and 'cottage cheese-like'), and sometimes pain or discomfort during intercourse or urination. Sharp abdominal pain is not a typical or primary symptom of a vaginal yeast infection, making the given diagnosis highly unlikely based solely on the symptom provided.",Acute Gastroenteritis
doctor i have been experiencing fluid in my ear along with fever facial pain and redness in my ear what could be the issue,based on your symptoms it seems that you are suffering from a condition called mastoiditis,0.2730638384819031,False,True,"The patient's symptoms of fluid in the ear (ear discharge), fever, facial pain, and redness in the ear are highly consistent with mastoiditis. Mastoiditis is typically a complication of an untreated or severe middle ear infection (otitis media), where the infection spreads to the mastoid bone behind the ear. The presence of fever and ear discharge strongly indicates an active infection. Facial pain and prominent redness, especially if located behind the ear or extending from the ear, suggest a more extensive inflammatory process beyond a simple ear infection, which aligns well with the diagnosis of mastoiditis. While some symptoms overlap with severe acute otitis media, the constellation, particularly the facial pain, points to a more serious complication.",mastoiditis

Other conditions more commonly present with these two symptoms.",Diabetes Mellitus
doctor ive been experiencing shoulder cramps or spasms pain during pregnancy pain or soreness of breast and also facial and ankle pain what could be the reason behind it,based on your symptoms it seems like you might be suffering from lead poisoning it is a condition caused by exposure to lead which can lead to the symptoms you just mentioned,0.2739705443382263,False,False,"The symptoms provided, particularly breast pain/soreness and generalized musculoskeletal pains (shoulder, ankle), are very common physiological discomforts during pregnancy due to hormonal changes, weight gain, and altered biomechanics. Facial pain, while less specific, can also arise from various pregnancy-related factors like sinusitis or headaches. While lead poisoning can cause joint and muscle pain, it typically presents with a different constellation of symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, constipation, neurological issues, fatigue, and cognitive impairments, and does not commonly manifest with breast pain or primarily diffuse musculoskeletal discomforts in this manner.

While lead poisoning can cause irritability and diffuse muscle/joint pain (arthralgia/myalgia), severe, localized ankle pain is not a primary or highly specific symptom. The combination of these symptoms points more strongly towards an acute musculoskeletal issue in the ankle, with the emotional distress potentially being a secondary effect of dealing with significant pain and limited mobility, or an unrelated co-occurring issue.",Ankle sprain

The patient's symptoms, which include cramps, spasms, headache, fever, redness in the ear, and a cough, are not typical for hyperhidrosis. These symptoms strongly suggest an acute infectious process, particularly with inflammatory signs such as fever and localized redness in the ear, along with systemic symptoms like headache, cough, and myalgia (cramps and spasms).

Its typical symptoms include fatigue, weakness, dull right upper quadrant pain, and in advanced stages, jaundice, ascites, and easy bruising/bleeding. The reported symptoms of regurgitation and prominent joint pain are not characteristic or direct manifestations of NASH. While nausea, diarrhea, and nosebleeds can occur in various conditions, including some liver diseases (especially advanced ones), their combination with significant joint pain and regurgitation does not highly suggest NASH as the primary diagnosis.

Frequent use of painkillers/analgesics, particularly NSAIDs, is a major risk factor for gastritis, peptic ulcers, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which can manifest as blood in stool and throat irritation (due to reflux). Alcohol abuse independently exacerbates these GI issues. The doctor's inquiry about painkiller use correctly identifies a critical factor that, alongside alcohol abuse, provides a strong pathophysiological explanation for the patient's physical symptoms. The psychological symptoms (low self-esteem, depression) are also consistent with chronic pain (headaches) and substance abuse.","NSAID-induced Gastrointestinal Complications (e.g., gastritis, peptic ulcer disease with bleeding), exacerbated by alcohol abuse."

Analgesic poisoning typically presents with acute physiological symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, liver damage, kidney dysfunction, or respiratory depression, depending on the type of analgesic. While throat irritation could be a non-specific symptom, and drug use during pregnancy is problematic, the core symptoms of low self-esteem, hostile behavior, and explicit alcohol abuse are characteristic indicators of Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and its wide range of psychological, social, and physical complications, including adverse pregnancy outcomes and irritation of the upper GI tract.",Alcohol Use Disorder with associated complications

The patient's symptoms of an itchy eyelid, vulvar sore, shoulder swelling, and wrist weakness are not characteristic or specific manifestations of cryptococcosis. Vulvar sores, in particular, are highly atypical for this fungal infection, as are localized inflammatory joint symptoms like shoulder swelling and wrist weakness.

doctor i have been experiencing leg swelling and fluid retention whats wrong with me,those symptoms indicate that you have pulmonary congestion,0.2583987116813659,False,False,"The patient's symptoms of 'leg swelling and fluid retention' primarily indicate peripheral edema and systemic fluid overload. While these can be associated with conditions that also cause pulmonary congestion (e.g., heart failure), the symptoms provided by the patient do not directly or highly suggest pulmonary congestion without additional respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, or orthopnea.

doctor i have redness in my ear cough mouth ulcers abnormal appearing skin and decreased appetite what could be happening to me,it sounds like you might have herpangina,0.2458561658859253,False,False,"Herpangina typically presents with painful, blister-like ulcers primarily located on the posterior soft palate, tonsils, uvula, and pharynx. While mouth ulcers and decreased appetite are consistent, the presence of 'cough,' 'redness in ear,' and especially 'abnormal appearing skin' are not characteristic features of herpangina. The description of 'abnormal appearing skin' alongside mouth ulcers is highly suggestive of a more widespread viral exanthem. Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) is a more fitting diagnosis as it commonly presents with oral ulcers and a rash on the skin, often involving the hands, feet, and sometimes other areas, along with other non-specific viral symptoms like cough and decreased appetite.","Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease"

The patient's reported symptoms of weakness, fatigue, cough, and a perceived allergic reaction are general constitutional symptoms, a respiratory symptom, and an immunological/inflammatory response, respectively. These do not align with the diagnostic criteria or common presentations of conversion disorder. Instead, they are highly suggestive of an acute general medical illness.",Acute Viral Infection
doctor ive been experiencing sinus congestion neck pain and headaches what could be the problem,it seems like you might have suffered an injury to the trunk which is causing all these symptoms we need to exam you more closely and may need to run some tests to come up with a definite diagnosis,0.2763771712779999,False,False,"The doctor's diagnosis of a 'trunk injury' is highly incongruent with the patient's reported symptoms of 'sinus congestion', 'neck pain', and 'headaches'. Sinus congestion and headaches are classic symptoms of conditions affecting the head and upper respiratory system (e.g., sinusitis, common cold, allergies). Neck pain, while a general symptom, is rarely, if ever, primarily caused by a trunk injury in conjunction with sinus issues. A trunk injury primarily affects the torso (chest, abdomen, back) and typically presents with localized pain, bruising, swelling, or functional limitations in that area, not sinus-related symptoms.",Acute Sinusitis
doctor i have been having some symptoms in my scrotum and testes along with rib pain and lower body pain what could be causing this,it seems like you may have suffered an injury to your trunk which can cause these symptoms we will need to do some further tests to determine the extent of the injury and the best course of treatment,0.2867809534072876,False,False,"While a 'trunk injury' could explain rib pain and potentially some lower body pain, it is less likely to be the primary cause for the specific combination of rib pain, lower body pain, and particularly scrotum and testes pain. The described symptoms, especially the testicular/scrotal pain combined with rib/flank pain and lower body pain, are highly suggestive of a different etiology. Renal colic, often caused by kidney stones, characteristically presents with severe flank pain (which can be interpreted as rib pain), radiating to the lower abdomen, groin, and ipsilateral testis or scrotum, and can cause generalized lower body discomfort or back pain. This diagnosis provides a more cohesive explanation for all three symptom clusters than a general 'trunk injury'.",Renal Colic (Kidney Stones)

Oral Leukoplakia is primarily characterized by white or gray patches in the mouth or on the lips and typically does not present with systemic symptoms affecting weight, muscle strength, or peripheral muscle cramps/spasms. The symptoms provided, particularly the muscle cramps, spasms, and general weakness, strongly suggest a systemic issue, most commonly an electrolyte imbalance affecting neuromuscular function.",Hypomagnesemia

It does not primarily suggest Hirschsprung disease. Hirschsprung disease is a congenital condition characterized by a lack of nerve cells (ganglion cells) in the colon, leading to significant bowel movement issues such as chronic constipation, abdominal distension, and failure to pass meconium, predominantly in neonates and infants. These specific gastrointestinal symptoms are not reported by the patient, and a general sensation of 'hot and cold' is not a characteristic primary symptom of Hirschsprung disease.",Viral illness

West Nile Virus typically presents with symptoms such as fever, headache, body aches, joint pain, rash, and in severe cases, neurological symptoms like confusion, tremors, and seizures. The patient's specific symptoms of 'excessive urination at night' and 'facial pain' are not characteristic of West Nile Virus infection. While 'pain during pregnancy' is a general symptom, the combination of nocturnal polyuria and facial pain points away from WNV.

A more plausible alternative diagnosis for a pregnant patient experiencing pain, excessive urination at night, and facial pain would be Pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a serious pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, most often the liver and kidneys. Key symptoms can include severe headaches (which may be described as facial pain or pressure), pain (e.g., epigastric or right upper quadrant pain), and swelling. While 'excessive urination at night' (nocturia/polyuria) is not a cardinal symptom of pre-eclampsia (oliguria is more common in severe forms), changes in kidney function are central, and any significant change in urinary patterns in pregnancy warrants investigation. Given the presence of facial pain (potentially severe headache) and general pain in a pregnant patient, pre-eclampsia represents a more critical and encompassing alternative diagnosis to consider than WNV.",Pre-eclampsia

While chronic sun exposure (as confirmed by the patient) is a known factor for various dermatological issues, including some rashes and photoaging, the symptom 'lack of growth on my skin' is highly suggestive of skin atrophy, scarring, or impaired regeneration. Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus (CLE), particularly Discoid Lupus Erythematosus, commonly presents with photosensitive facial rashes that characteristically lead to atrophy, scarring, and permanent changes in skin texture (e.g., hypopigmentation, thinning of skin), which aligns very well with a 'lack of growth' of normal skin. While sun exposure can exacerbate or trigger CLE, the specific combination of a facial rash and definitive 'lack of growth' (implying atrophy/scarring) points more directly towards CLE than to a general category of sun-related skin conditions like actinic keratoses (which are abnormal growths) or polymorphous light eruption (which is primarily an inflammatory rash without significant atrophy). Therefore, while the doctor's line of questioning is relevant, the symptoms do not 'highly suggest' a generic sun-related diagnosis, and Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus provides a more precise fit for the entire symptom complex.",Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus
doctor i have been experiencing some wrist weakness and emotional symptoms lately what could be the problem,have you been using insulin medicationpatient yes i have,0.2751337587833404,False,True,"Wrist weakness can be a manifestation of general weakness, tremors, or neurological impairment often seen in hypoglycemia. Emotional symptoms, such as irritability, confusion, and anxiety, are classic signs of hypoglycemia, which is a common complication of insulin medication if not properly managed or if too much insulin is administered. Therefore, the symptoms highly suggest that hypoglycemia, a condition related to insulin use, could be the problem.",Hypoglycemia (related to insulin medication use)
doctor ive been experiencing nailbiting and diarrhea lately what could be causing this,based on your symptoms it is possible that you are experiencing an insulin overdose,0.2815889716148376,False,False,"The symptoms provided, 'nailbiting' and 'diarrhea', do not highly suggest an 'insulin overdose'. Nailbiting is commonly associated with anxiety, stress, or nervousness. Diarrhea can have numerous causes, including infections, dietary factors, and psychological stress. Insulin overdose, leading to hypoglycemia, typically presents with symptoms such as shakiness, sweating, confusion, dizziness, hunger, rapid heart rate, and sometimes loss of consciousness or seizures. Diarrhea and nailbiting are not primary or common symptoms of insulin overdose.",Anxiety with stress-induced gastrointestinal symptoms
doctor i have been experiencing shoulder pain headache and weakness lately what could be the problem,based on your symptoms it is possible that you have siadh which stands for syndrome of inappropriate secretion of adh,0.2796749472618103,False,False,"The combination of symptoms described, particularly localized shoulder pain, does not strongly suggest SIADH (Syndrome of Inappropriate Secretion of ADH). While headache and generalized weakness can be symptoms of SIADH due to hyponatremia, shoulder pain is not a characteristic or primary symptom of this condition. SIADH typically presents with neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms related to electrolyte imbalance. The presence of shoulder pain, alongside headache and weakness, points more towards a systemic inflammatory process or a musculoskeletal issue combined with general malaise.",Viral infection
doctor i have been experiencing facial pain along with shoulder cramps or spasms and also ankle pain what could be the reason for these symptoms,based on your symptoms it is likely that you are suffering from leishmaniasis a parasitic disease caused by the bite of infected sandflies,0.2400694340467453,False,False,"The patient's reported symptoms of facial pain, shoulder cramps or spasms, and ankle pain do not align with the typical presentation of Leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease, primarily manifests as cutaneous lesions (sores, ulcers), mucocutaneous destruction, or visceral symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and organ enlargement (spleen, liver). Muscle cramps, spasms, and isolated joint pain like ankle pain are not characteristic symptoms of Leishmaniasis. Therefore, the diagnosis is highly unlikely based on the provided symptom description.",Fibromyalgia
doctor i am experiencing side pain arm stiffness or tightness shoulder swelling and also pain or soreness of the breast what could be the problem,based on your symptoms it is possible that you have syringomyelia it is a rare disease that occurs when a fluidfilled cyst forms in the spinal cord leading to various symptoms including the ones you have described it is important to get a proper diagnosis and treatment,0.2891940474510193,False,False,"The doctor's diagnosis of Syringomyelia is unlikely given the patient's reported symptoms. Syringomyelia, a condition involving a fluid-filled cyst in the spinal cord, can cause arm stiffness and pain due to nerve damage. However, it does not typically manifest with localized **shoulder swelling** or **pain or soreness of the breast**. Shoulder swelling is a strong indicator of an inflammatory process within the shoulder joint or surrounding soft tissues (e.g., bursitis, tendinitis, or arthritis). Pain or soreness of the breast (mastalgia) is generally related to breast tissue, hormonal factors, or musculoskeletal issues of the chest wall, not directly from a spinal cord syrinx.

Conversely, the combination of **shoulder swelling, pain, and stiffness**, along with **arm stiffness**, strongly points towards a systemic inflammatory condition affecting the joints. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)** is a chronic inflammatory disorder that commonly affects peripheral joints like the shoulder, causing pain, stiffness, and characteristic swelling (synovitis). Furthermore, RA can be associated with musculoskeletal chest wall pain, including **costochondritis** (inflammation of the cartilage connecting ribs to the sternum), which can present as pain or soreness in the breast area, fitting the patient's description of 'pain or soreness of the breast' and 'side pain'. This makes Rheumatoid Arthritis a significantly more plausible diagnosis.",Rheumatoid Arthritis
doctor i have been experiencing some symptoms lately i have gained weight and been having nightmares,it sounds like you might be experiencing symptoms of mitral valve disease have you been experiencing any shortness of breath or fatigue as well,0.2276772111654281,False,False,"The patient's reported symptoms of weight gain and nightmares do not highly suggest mitral valve disease. Common symptoms of mitral valve disease include shortness of breath, fatigue, heart palpitations, and chest pain. While severe heart failure associated with MVD can lead to fluid retention (potentially perceived as weight gain) and sleep disturbances, these are not the primary or most direct indicators. Nightmares are not a typical primary symptom of mitral valve disease.",Depression
doctor i have been experiencing coryza for a few days now what could it be,it seems like you might be suffering from otitis media which is an inflammation of the middle ear,0.2833468317985534,False,False,"Coryza, commonly known as a runny nose, is a primary symptom of a common cold or allergic rhinitis, affecting the nasal passages. While an upper respiratory infection (like a cold) can sometimes precede or accompany otitis media, coryza alone for a few days does not strongly suggest otitis media, which primarily involves inflammation of the middle ear and typically presents with ear pain, hearing changes, or ear fullness. The diagnosis of otitis media based solely on 'coryza' is premature and less likely without additional ear-specific symptoms.",Acute Viral Rhinitis (Common Cold)
hi doctor i have been experiencing a lot of anxiety and nervousness lately especially in the morning,have you been using any drugs or opioids recentlypatient actually yes i have been using opioids for my back pain,0.2309561371803283,False,True,"The patient's symptoms of anxiety and nervousness, particularly in the morning, are highly consistent with symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Opioid withdrawal commonly manifests with anxiety, restlessness, and dysphoria, often worsening as the last dose wears off, which aligns with morning exacerbation. The doctor's inquiry about opioid use and the patient's subsequent admission directly supports this diagnostic direction.",Opioid Withdrawal
doctor i have been experiencing chills lately,it might be due to myelodysplastic syndrome,0.2834731936454773,False,False,"Chills are a very non-specific symptom commonly associated with various conditions, most notably infections (viral or bacterial), fever, or even environmental factors. While patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) can experience fevers and chills due to increased susceptibility to infections (a common complication of the disease caused by bone marrow failure and neutropenia), chills alone are not a highly suggestive primary diagnostic indicator for MDS. MDS typically presents with more specific symptoms related to cytopenias such as persistent fatigue, weakness, easy bruising, bleeding, or recurrent, severe infections. Therefore, 'chills' alone do not highly suggest MDS.",Viral Infection

Methamphetamine is a powerful stimulant that causes significant cardiovascular and central nervous system activation, leading to increased heart rate (palpitations), elevated blood pressure, and heightened states of anxiety and nervousness. Shortness of breath can result from increased metabolic demand, rapid heart rate, or generalized anxiety associated with stimulant use. Therefore, the doctor's diagnosis is highly plausible given the reported symptoms.",side effects of methamphetamine abuse

While frequent alcohol consumption can contribute to conditions like gastritis, esophagitis (reflux), or even pancreatitis which may manifest as chest pain, the symptom 'sharp chest pain' alone does not *highly suggest* an alcohol-related etiology as the primary diagnosis. Many other common conditions, such as musculoskeletal issues (e.g., costochondritis) or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) not directly linked to heavy alcohol use, frequently present with similar pain and would typically be considered in the initial differential diagnosis without additional specific symptoms pointing towards alcohol as the sole cause.",Costochondritis

Scurvy, a vitamin C deficiency, primarily manifests with symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, bleeding gums, easy bruising, poor wound healing, and widespread joint pain or swelling. None of these primary symptoms are explicitly described by the patient. The described symptoms, particularly the combination of pelvic pressure, bedwetting, and eye strain, point towards a different underlying condition, potentially affecting neurological or genitourinary systems.",Multiple Sclerosis

Impulse control disorder is a psychiatric condition characterized by difficulties in resisting impulses and urges, with symptoms related to mood, behavior, and social interactions, not directly affecting menstrual cycles. Therefore, the diagnosis of impulse control disorder is highly unlikely to be related to the stated symptom.",Hormonal Imbalance
doctor i have been having a sore throat and loss of appetite lately,you might have an abscess of the nose,0.2665646374225616,False,False,"A sore throat and loss of appetite are not typical or primary symptoms of an abscess of the nose. Nasal abscesses usually present with localized pain, swelling, and redness around the nose. Sore throat is a symptom of pharyngeal inflammation, and loss of appetite is a general symptom that can accompany many illnesses but is not specific to a nasal abscess.",Acute Viral Pharyngitis

Nosebleeds, skin rash, and diminished hearing are not typical or primary manifestations of adrenal cancer. This combination of symptoms—upper respiratory tract involvement (nosebleeds), skin manifestations (rash), and otologic involvement (diminished hearing)—is highly suggestive of a systemic autoimmune or vasculitic condition affecting multiple organ systems.",Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)
doctor i have been experiencing chest tightness lately,you might be suffering from chronic rheumatic fever have you experienced any joint pain or fever as well,0.2750071287155151,False,False,"The symptom 'chest tightness' is extremely non-specific and does not highly suggest a diagnosis of chronic rheumatic fever. Chronic rheumatic fever is a serious condition resulting from repeated or untreated strep infections, primarily affecting the heart valves (rheumatic heart disease). While advanced rheumatic heart disease can lead to symptoms like dyspnea (shortness of breath), which might be described as tightness, due to heart failure, it's typically accompanied by a history of rheumatic fever, specific cardiac murmurs, or other systemic symptoms. Isolated chest tightness, without any mention of joint pain (as the doctor probed), fever, or other cardinal symptoms of rheumatic fever or severe heart disease, is insufficient to highly suggest this specific diagnosis.",Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)

However, 'fluid in the ear' is not a typical or direct symptom of chronic rheumatic fever. The combination of fluid in the ear and dizziness strongly suggests an ear-related disorder (e.g., middle ear pathology, inner ear dysfunction), which is not a primary manifestation of rheumatic fever. Therefore, the provided symptoms do not highly suggest the recorded diagnosis.",Heart Failure Exacerbation
doctor i have been feeling nauseous lately do you know whats wrong with me,have you noticed any lumps or swelling in your testiclespatient yes come to think of it there has been a lump in one of them for a while,0.2751051783561706,False,False,"The patient's initial symptom of 'nauseous lately' is a highly non-specific symptom and does not strongly suggest a testicular lump or testicular cancer. Nausea can be caused by a wide range of conditions, most commonly gastrointestinal issues, infections, or dietary factors. While advanced testicular cancer can sometimes cause nausea, it is not a primary or highly indicative symptom in isolation. The doctor's subsequent questioning was crucial in uncovering the specific and relevant symptom of a testicular lump, which is directly indicative of a potential testicular issue, but this was not directly suggested by the initial complaint of nausea.",Gastroenteritis
doctor i have been experiencing difficulty in swallowing nosebleeds vaginal pain and pain in my anus what could be causing these symptoms,based on your symptoms it is likely that you are suffering from anemia due to malignancy which occurs when cancer cells cause bleeding and damage to the bodys red blood cells its important we begin treatment as soon as possible to address the underlying malignancy and manage your anemia,0.2366273701190948,False,True,"The combination of difficulty swallowing, recurrent nosebleeds, vaginal pain, and anal pain are concerning and disparate symptoms that could collectively indicate a systemic issue. Each of these symptoms, particularly when persistent, can be a red flag for malignancy in the respective anatomical areas (e.g., esophageal, vaginal, anal cancers) or a widespread systemic malignancy affecting multiple sites (e.g., lymphoma, metastatic disease). Anemia is a very common complication of various malignancies, arising from chronic blood loss (e.g., from gastrointestinal, gynecological, or anal lesions), bone marrow infiltration, or as an anemia of chronic disease. Therefore, 'anemia due to malignancy' is a highly plausible and unifying diagnosis that warrants urgent investigation given the constellation of symptoms.","anemia due to malignancy, which occurs when cancer cells cause bleeding and damage to the body's red blood cells"

While severe anemia or certain malignancies can manifest with bleeding symptoms like nosebleeds (often due to associated thrombocytopenia or clotting factor deficiencies), nosebleeds alone are not a highly specific or primary indicator of 'anemia due to malignancy.' This is a very specific and severe diagnosis that would typically be suggested by a broader constellation of symptoms beyond just recurrent nosebleeds, such as significant fatigue, unexplained weight loss, easy bruising, or other signs of advanced disease. More common and less serious conditions should be considered first when the primary complaint is nosebleeds.",Allergic Rhinitis
doctor i have been feeling ill lately and my ribs hurt i also have a history of drug abuse what could be causing this,it sounds like you may be suffering from glucocorticoid deficiency this condition occurs when the adrenal glands dont produce enough of the hormone cortisol which can cause symptoms like the ones you described lets get some tests to confirm the diagnosis,0.2781665325164795,False,False,"While 'feeling ill' is a non-specific symptom that could align with general malaise in glucocorticoid deficiency, the symptom 'ribs hurt' combined with a 'history of drug abuse' strongly directs suspicion away from glucocorticoid deficiency and towards alternative diagnoses. Glucocorticoid deficiency presents with symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, and diffuse muscle/joint pain, but specific, localized rib pain is not a prominent or classic feature. The history of drug abuse significantly increases the risk for infections, particularly osteomyelitis (bone infection) of the ribs or vertebrae, endocarditis with septic emboli, or other soft tissue and pulmonary infections, which are far more likely to cause localized rib pain and general malaise in this patient population. The doctor's diagnosis does not adequately account for the highly relevant drug abuse history or the specific nature of the pain.",Osteomyelitis
doctor i have been having some redness in my ear facial pain toothache sore throat and ear pain what could be the issue,it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder also known as tmj,0.2996283173561096,False,False,"The doctor's diagnosis of Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) disorder is unlikely to be correct given the full spectrum of symptoms. While facial pain, toothache, and ear pain can be associated with TMJ, the presence of 'redness in my ear' and particularly 'sore throat' are not typical symptoms of TMJ. Sore throat is a strong indicator of pharyngitis or tonsillitis, which often precede or co-occur with ear infections (otitis media) due to shared anatomical pathways and common pathogens. Acute Otitis Media (middle ear infection) more comprehensively explains ear pain, potential redness in the ear (of the eardrum or secondary inflammation), and often presents with or after a sore throat. Facial pain and toothache can also be referred pain from a severe ear infection or general inflammation in the head and neck region.",Acute Otitis Media
doctor ive been having some trouble with my vision lately and im also experiencing apnea and insomnia what could be causing this,based on your symptoms its possible that you have wilsons disease this is a condition where copper builds up in the body and can cause neurological and psychiatric symptoms as well as liver disease have you been experiencing any other symptoms,0.2750735878944397,False,False,"The patient explicitly reports 'apnea' and 'insomnia,' which are direct and primary symptoms of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). OSA is characterized by recurrent episodes of cessation of breathing during sleep, leading to fragmented sleep and subsequent insomnia. The 'trouble with vision' could be a secondary symptom resulting from chronic sleep deprivation, fatigue, and impaired concentration commonly experienced by individuals with OSA. Wilson's disease, while affecting the nervous system and potentially vision (e.g., Kayser-Fleischer rings or oculomotor dysfunction), does not typically present with apnea and insomnia as its most prominent or directly indicative symptoms.",Obstructive Sleep Apnea
doctor i have been experiencing apnea difficulty eating and swallowing what could be the cause of these symptoms,based on your symptoms it is possible that you have wilson disease it is a rare genetic disorder that causes copper to accumulate in various organs of the body such as the liver brain and eyes which could lead to these symptoms,0.2460788488388061,False,False,"The combination of apnea, difficulty eating, and swallowing, while indicative of neurological or neuromuscular involvement, does not highly suggest Wilson disease. Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder where copper accumulation can lead to various symptoms, including neurological signs like tremors, dystonia, and sometimes dysphagia in advanced stages. However, apnea is not a primary or typical presenting symptom. The constellation of apnea, difficulty eating, and difficulty swallowing strongly points towards a condition affecting the brainstem, neuromuscular junction, or respiratory muscles. Myasthenia Gravis (MG), a more common autoimmune neuromuscular disorder, often presents with fluctuating weakness that affects bulbar muscles (leading to dysphagia and difficulty eating) and can progress to involve respiratory muscles, causing respiratory insufficiency or even apnea during a myasthenic crisis. This aligns much more closely with all three reported symptoms than Wilson disease.",Myasthenia Gravis
doctor ive been experiencing eye strain and i also noticed a knee lump or mass what could it be,these symptoms may be caused by vitamin a deficiency its important to get your blood tested to diagnose it accurately,0.2475163638591766,False,False,"Vitamin A deficiency primarily affects vision, immune function, and epithelial tissues, leading to symptoms like night blindness, dry eyes (xerophthalmia), and impaired immunity. It does not cause a knee lump or mass. While eye strain can be a very general symptom, its presence alongside a distinct knee lump makes Vitamin A deficiency an extremely unlikely unifying cause for these combined symptoms. The doctor's diagnosis is therefore highly incorrect.",Sarcoidosis

Vitamin A deficiency primarily affects vision (e.g., night blindness, xerophthalmia), skin (e.g., dry skin, follicular hyperkeratosis), and immune function. It does not cause localized vulvar sores or swollen joints. These symptoms, particularly the combination of mucosal ulcers and joint inflammation, are highly suggestive of a systemic inflammatory condition. The doctor's diagnosis is therefore highly unlikely given the patient's presentation.",Behçet's Disease

This is a specific manifestation of Cat Scratch Disease (CSD) caused by Bartonella henselae, where the pathogen enters through the conjunctiva, leading to unilateral conjunctivitis, swollen lymph nodes (often preauricular or submandibular), and general malaise. A headache is a common systemic symptom associated with CSD. The doctor's targeted questioning to ascertain the cat scratch history was crucial and appropriate, making the implied diagnosis highly plausible.",Cat Scratch Disease (Oculoglandular Syndrome of Parinaud)

While rare neurological complications can occur with Cat Scratch Disease (CSD), such as encephalitis or myelitis, 'loss of sensation' itself is not a typical, common, or highly suggestive primary symptom of CSD. CSD is primarily characterized by lymphadenopathy and a primary skin lesion. Therefore, linking a generalized loss of sensation directly and highly to a cat scratch is not strongly supported without other specific indicators.",Peripheral Neuropathy

While 'excessive anger' could be interpreted as agitation, 'pain in my eye' is not a characteristic or primary symptom of rabies. Furthermore, without any mention of animal contact, rabies is a highly unlikely initial diagnosis based solely on the provided symptoms.

doctor i have been experiencing excessive anger my nails have irregular appearance it hurts when i breathe and my legs are swollen,these symptoms are indicative of diabetic kidney disease it is important to manage your blood sugar levels and monitor kidney function to prevent further damage treatment may include medication and lifestyle changes,0.2278017103672027,False,False,"The symptom 'swollen legs' is consistent with diabetic kidney disease due to fluid retention, often associated with proteinuria. Irregular nail appearance can also be observed in chronic kidney disease. However, 'hurts when I breathe' is not a primary or highly specific symptom of diabetic kidney disease in its typical presentation. While severe fluid overload from advanced kidney failure can cause breathing difficulties (dyspnea), the description 'hurts when I breathe' more strongly suggests pleuritic pain, pericarditis, or angina, which are more directly indicative of cardiac or pulmonary conditions. Uremic pericarditis can occur in end-stage renal disease, but the symptoms provided do not exclusively point to this advanced stage. Given the combination of 'swollen legs' (peripheral edema) and 'hurts when I breathe' (potentially from pulmonary edema, pleural effusion, or cardiac pain), along with the non-specific 'excessive anger', Congestive Heart Failure provides a more comprehensive explanation for the constellation of symptoms. Diabetic patients are also at a significantly increased risk for developing heart failure.",Congestive Heart Failure

These symptoms point towards fluid overload and impaired cardiac function. While late-stage (tertiary) syphilis can rarely affect the cardiovascular system and lead to heart failure, it is not the most common or direct cause for this specific cluster of symptoms. The 'arm lump' is a non-specific symptom that does not typically align with the primary or secondary stages of syphilis, nor is it a direct symptom of its cardiovascular manifestations.

While syphilis, particularly in its secondary stage, can present with flu-like symptoms including muscle aches, it is highly unlikely to be the *most likely* diagnosis when muscle pain is the *only* symptom reported. Syphilis typically has more specific hallmark symptoms, such as chancres (primary stage) or a characteristic rash (secondary stage), often accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy, which were not mentioned.

While advanced diabetic kidney disease can manifest with dyspnea (due to fluid overload, anemia, or metabolic acidosis) and potentially pain (e.g., uremic pleuritis, pericarditis, or musculoskeletal pain), these are typically features of severe or complicated disease. The initial, non-specific complaint does not *highly suggest* diabetic kidney disease as the most direct or primary diagnosis. Common acute conditions directly causing this symptom combination are more likely candidates. The doctor's subsequent questions about swelling and fatigue are relevant to kidney disease but do not validate the initial diagnostic leap given the primary symptoms.",Pneumonia

While a 'nose disorder' (e.g., severe sinusitis leading to Eustachian tube dysfunction) can sometimes cause referred ear pain, it is not the most direct or primary diagnosis for isolated ear pain without other specific nasal symptoms mentioned. The diagnosis of 'nose disorder' is also quite vague. More common and direct causes of ear pain should be considered first.",Otitis media

A fracture of the neck (cervical spine) typically causes pain, stiffness, and neurological symptoms in the neck, shoulders, and upper extremities. While severe cervical issues can sometimes impact swallowing, regurgitation is a distinct gastrointestinal symptom. Furthermore, a neck fracture does not commonly cause referred pain to the groin, bladder, or low back.

Hemophilia is a genetic bleeding disorder characterized by excessive bleeding, bruising, and joint pain due to bleeds, not by amenorrhea or cough. While leg pain can occur in hemophilia due to joint bleeds, it is not a primary indicator without other bleeding symptoms. The absence of menstruation is a significant symptom that is unrelated to hemophilia. The combination of amenorrhea and leg pain, with a general symptom like cough, points more strongly towards pregnancy as a possible cause.",Pregnancy
doctor i have been experiencing fainting burning chest pain cough dryness in my mouth and diminished vision what could be the problem,based on your symptoms you may be experiencing hyperosmotic hyperketotic state which can occur in people with uncontrolled type diabetes this is a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention,0.2985510230064392,False,False,"While symptoms such as fainting, dryness in the mouth, and diminished vision can be associated with severe dehydration and hyperglycemia as seen in a hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), the prominent 'burning chest pain' and 'cough' are not typical or primary symptoms of HHS. Burning chest pain strongly suggests a cardiac (e.g., angina, myocardial infarction), pulmonary (e.g., pleurisy, pneumonia), or gastrointestinal issue, and a cough points directly to a respiratory pathology. Therefore, the complete set of presented symptoms does not highly suggest HHS as the most comprehensive diagnosis.",Pneumonia
doctor i am constantly thirsty no matter how much water i drink,based on your symptoms you may be experiencing a hyperosmotic hyperketotic state,0.2728440761566162,False,False,"Polydipsia (excessive thirst) is a classic symptom of uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus due to hyperglycemia leading to osmotic diuresis and subsequent fluid loss. While a 'hyperosmotic hyperketotic state' is a severe metabolic complication that can arise from uncontrolled diabetes (e.g., Diabetic Ketoacidosis), it is not the primary diagnosis for the isolated symptom of constant thirst. The symptom itself most directly points to the underlying disease causing the thirst, rather than a specific, severe metabolic derangement without other accompanying symptoms like polyuria, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, or altered mental status that would suggest a critical state.",Diabetes Mellitus
doctor ive been experiencing joint stiffness and tightness along with fatigue also ive noticed a strange lump or mass on my knee what could be the problem,based on your symptoms its possible that you have a fat embolism this occurs when small globs of fat circulate in your blood and become lodged in your blood vessels leading to restricted blood flow and reduced oxygen supply to your tissues,0.2773617804050445,False,False,"The doctor's diagnosis of a fat embolism does not align with the patient's reported symptoms. A fat embolism is an acute, systemic condition typically associated with major trauma (like long bone fractures) or surgery, and its primary symptoms include respiratory distress, neurological dysfunction, and a petechial rash. Joint stiffness, tightness, and especially a localized 'lump or mass on my knee' are not characteristic symptoms of a fat embolism. The presence of a localized lump on the knee combined with joint stiffness and fatigue strongly suggests a localized musculoskeletal issue rather than a systemic circulatory problem.",Baker's cyst (Popliteal cyst)
doctor i have been experiencing shoulder cramps and spasms lately i also feel tired often and have been having pain in my eye what could be wrong with me,it is possible that you are experiencing symptoms of fat embolism have you had any recent injuries or surgeries,0.2571937441825866,False,False,"The patient's reported symptoms of shoulder cramps and spasms, persistent fatigue, and eye pain do not align with the typical presentation of a fat embolism. Fat embolism syndrome is usually characterized by respiratory distress, neurological deficits (e.g., confusion, agitation, disorientation), and a petechial rash, often occurring after major trauma or surgery. The patient does not describe these hallmark symptoms. While 'pain in my eye' could potentially be very vaguely linked to retinal changes in severe FES, it is not a primary or characteristic symptom, and the other symptoms are inconsistent. The constellation of muscle cramps/spasms, chronic fatigue, and eye pain is more suggestive of other neurological or autoimmune conditions.",Multiple Sclerosis
doctor i have been experiencing weight gain itching of skin regurgitation symptoms of eye and joint pain lately what could be the reason for these symptoms,it seems like you might be suffering from polycythemia vera a rare blood disorder that causes your body to produce excess red blood cells these symptoms are quite common in patients with this disease,0.2881361842155456,False,False,"While pruritus (itching) and joint pain can be associated with Polycythemia Vera (PV), weight gain is not a typical symptom; patients with PV are more likely to experience weight loss due to an increased metabolic rate. Furthermore, 'regurgitation symptoms of eye' is an unusual and vague description, and not a recognized or common ocular manifestation directly linked to PV. The constellation of symptoms, particularly the weight gain, does not highly suggest Polycythemia Vera.",Hypothyroidism
doctor i have a lump in my throat what could be the reason,based on your symptoms you might have a goiter,0.2735136747360229,False,True,"A goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland, which is located in the neck. A common symptom of a goiter is a visible or palpable lump in the throat or neck area. Patients often describe this as a 'lump in my throat' or a sensation of fullness. Therefore, the symptom highly suggests a goiter as a plausible and common diagnosis.",goiter
doctor i have been experiencing double vision fatigue nasal congestion cough and weakness do you have any idea what could be causing these symptoms,yes after considering your symptoms i believe you may have muscular dystrophy unfortunately there is no cure for this disease but we can work together to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life,0.2475338727235794,False,False,"The symptoms provided do not highly suggest muscular dystrophy. Muscular dystrophy is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and fatigue, but typically does not present with double vision, nasal congestion, or cough as primary or early symptoms. Double vision strongly indicates an issue with the extraocular muscles or neurological control, while nasal congestion and cough are more indicative of a respiratory infection or allergy, or in some contexts, a systemic inflammatory process. These specific symptoms are not consistent with a typical presentation of muscular dystrophy.",Myasthenia Gravis
doctor i am having difficulty in swallowing cough groin pain and coryza what could be the problem,based on your symptoms i believe you may have scarlet fever,0.2459645569324493,False,False,"Scarlet fever is a bacterial infection typically presenting with a sore throat, fever, rash, and strawberry tongue, but it generally lacks prominent coryza (runny nose/nasal congestion) and cough, which are characteristic of viral upper respiratory infections. Furthermore, groin pain is a highly atypical symptom for scarlet fever. The combination of coryza, cough, and difficulty swallowing points away from scarlet fever and more towards a viral etiology. While difficulty swallowing can occur, the other symptoms contradict a scarlet fever diagnosis.",Viral Upper Respiratory Infection
doctor i have been feeling so angry lately and its been hard to control it,have you been using any drugs or substances recently patient yes i have been using cocaine occasionally,0.2890761494636535,False,True,"Anger, irritability, and difficulty controlling emotions are well-documented psychological and behavioral effects of cocaine use. Cocaine, a potent stimulant, can lead to mood dysregulation, agitation, and increased aggression, particularly during intoxication or chronic use. Given the patient's admission of occasional cocaine use in response to the doctor's query, the connection between the symptoms and the substance is highly plausible and medically sound.",Cocaine-induced mood disorder (with prominent anger and irritability)
doctor i have an open wound on my cheek and fluid seems to be accumulating in the area what do you think it could be,based on your symptoms i believe you have a condition called a mucocele,0.289859265089035,False,False,"A mucocele is typically a closed, mucus-filled cyst resulting from trauma to a minor salivary gland duct, usually found on the oral mucosa (lips, inner cheek). While a mucocele can rupture and drain, the description 'open wound on my cheek and fluid seems to be accumulating in the area' more strongly suggests an active infection or a collection of pus. An abscess, which is a localized collection of pus often caused by bacterial infection, commonly presents with swelling that may eventually form an 'open wound' (e.g., a draining fistula or spontaneous rupture) with ongoing 'fluid' (pus) accumulation. This presentation aligns more closely with the patient's symptoms than a typical mucocele.",Abscess
doctor i have been experiencing diminished hearing weakness and disturbance of memory lately what is wrong with me,you might have a meningioma its a type of brain tumor that develops in the protective tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord i suggest we run some tests to confirm the diagnosis,0.2957641184329986,False,False,"The patient's symptoms of diminished hearing, weakness, and disturbance of memory are general neurological complaints. While a meningioma, a type of brain tumor, can potentially cause these symptoms depending on its size and location (e.g., affecting auditory pathways, motor cortex, or memory centers), these symptoms are not specific enough to 'highly suggest' a meningioma over several other conditions. The diagnosis of meningioma is plausible but not highly suggested by this symptom constellation alone. There are more common and often treatable conditions that can present with a similar combination of neurological symptoms.",Vitamin B12 Deficiency
doctor i have been experiencing melena which is black tarry stool what could be the reason for this,based on your symptoms it is possible that you are suffering from primary kidney disease which affects the functionality of your kidneys leading to such symptoms it is important that we perform further tests to ascertain the exact diagnosis,0.2636099755764007,False,False,"Melena, characterized by black tarry stools, is a classic sign of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The black color indicates that blood has been digested as it passes through the GI tract. Primary kidney disease, on the other hand, primarily affects renal function and typically presents with symptoms such as edema, hypertension, fatigue, changes in urine output, and electrolyte imbalances. While severe kidney disease can indirectly lead to gastrointestinal issues, including bleeding, due to uremia-induced gastritis or platelet dysfunction, it is not the most direct or common cause of melena, nor is melena a primary diagnostic symptom for kidney disease itself. The doctor's reasoning does not directly link kidney dysfunction to the symptom of melena.",Peptic Ulcer Disease
doctor ive been having some gum pain lately what could it be,well based on your medical history and current symptoms i would like to investigate further to check if you have uterine cancer,0.2155700623989105,False,False,"Gum pain is a localized symptom typically indicating issues within the oral cavity, such as dental problems (e.g., cavities, abscesses), gingivitis, periodontitis, or other oral infections. Uterine cancer, however, is a gynecological malignancy affecting the uterus, and its symptoms typically include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or changes in bowel/bladder habits. There is no medical correlation between gum pain and uterine cancer, making the given diagnosis highly improbable based solely on the provided symptom.",Gingivitis

While joint pain can occur, 'joint stiffness' and 'ankle pain' as the primary complaints without other systemic symptoms or a clear exposure history do not highly suggest leptospirosis. These symptoms are much more indicative of an inflammatory or degenerative joint condition.",Rheumatoid Arthritis

Leptospirosis is an acute bacterial infection typically characterized by fever, severe muscle aches (often in the calves), headache, chills, and conjunctival suffusion. The patient's reported symptoms of 'excessive anger,' 'pain or soreness of breast,' and a 'knee lump' are not characteristic of Leptospirosis. Instead, these symptoms point towards a condition that involves widespread pain, mood disturbances, and potentially localized musculoskeletal issues.",Fibromyalgia

While some general aches and fatigue might be present, 'excessive anger' is not a characteristic or primary symptom of leptospirosis. The combination of chronic joint stiffness, tightness, fatigue, wrist pain, and notably, 'excessive anger,' does not highly suggest leptospirosis. These symptoms are more indicative of conditions affecting both physical and psychological well-being.",Fibromyalgia
doctor ive been experiencing pain during my pregnancy pain in my eye and facial pain what could be causing these symptoms,based on the symptoms youve described its possible that you have leptospirosis ill need to do some tests to confirm the diagnosis but its important that you seek treatment as soon as possible,0.2443606257438659,False,False,"The patient's reported symptoms of 'pain during my pregnancy, pain in my eye, and facial pain' do not strongly align with the typical presentation of Leptospirosis. Common symptoms of Leptospirosis include fever, muscle aches, chills, headache, and conjunctival suffusion (red eyes), often accompanied by exposure history to contaminated water or animals. While eye pain can occur in some forms of Leptospirosis (e.g., uveitis), and headache can contribute to facial pain, the absence of other systemic symptoms like fever and myalgia, along with the specific emphasis on 'pain in my eye and facial pain,' makes Leptospirosis a less likely primary diagnosis without further information. The combination of severe unilateral eye and facial pain is more suggestive of primary headache disorders.",Cluster Headache
doctor ive been experiencing vomiting and leg pain whats wrong with me,you may be suffering from vertebrobasilar insufficiency which is caused by a decreased blood flow to your brainstem and cerebellum due to a narrowing or blockage in your vertebral or basilar arteries it can also cause other symptoms like dizziness difficulty speaking and vision problems,0.2641935348510742,False,False,"Vertebrobasilar insufficiency (VBI) primarily presents with neurological symptoms such as dizziness, vertigo, visual disturbances, difficulty speaking (dysarthria), and balance problems (ataxia), due to decreased blood flow to the brainstem and cerebellum. While nausea and vomiting can sometimes be associated, isolated leg pain is not a characteristic or primary symptom of VBI. A more common and directly linked explanation for concurrent vomiting and leg pain is dehydration and electrolyte imbalance resulting from prolonged vomiting, which can lead to muscle cramps or generalized myalgia.",Dehydration and Electrolyte Imbalance

These specific symptoms suggest a condition with broader systemic involvement, potentially affecting musculoskeletal, neurological, and gastrointestinal systems concurrently, which is not characteristic of iron overload alone.",Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis)
doctor i have been experiencing pelvic pain and my bones are painful as well what could be the cause,based on your symptoms it is possible that you have hemochromatosis which is an inherited condition that causes excess iron buildup in the body,0.2821037471294403,False,False,"Hemochromatosis is an inherited condition causing iron overload, which can lead to arthropathy (joint pain), often affecting the small joints of the hands, hips, knees, and shoulders. However, 'pelvic pain' is not a characteristic or primary symptom of hemochromatosis. While general joint pain might be described as 'bone pain', the combination with specific 'pelvic pain' does not highly suggest hemochromatosis as the most likely diagnosis. The symptoms are more consistent with other conditions.",Ankylosing Spondylitis
doctor i have been experiencing shoulder pain and some emotional symptoms recently what could be the problem,it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of cushing syndrome have you noticed any other changes in your body or mood,0.2891692221164703,False,False,"The symptoms of shoulder pain and emotional symptoms are highly non-specific and do not strongly point towards Cushing syndrome. While Cushing syndrome can involve emotional lability and musculoskeletal pain (often due to osteoporosis or muscle weakness), it typically presents with more characteristic physical signs such as moon face, buffalo hump, central obesity, skin thinning, and purple striae. These hallmark symptoms are absent in the provided information, making Cushing syndrome an unlikely primary diagnosis based solely on the given symptoms.",Generalized Anxiety Disorder
doctor i have been experiencing pain during pregnancy wrist pain and pain or soreness of breast what could be the reason for these symptoms,based on your symptoms it is possible that you have typhoid fever it is important that we conduct further tests to confirm this diagnosis and begin treatment immediately,0.2198260277509689,False,False,"The symptoms provided – 'pain during pregnancy', 'wrist pain', and 'pain or soreness of breast' – do not align with the typical presentation of typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a systemic infection characterized by high fever, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain, and sometimes a rash (rose spots). Wrist pain and breast soreness are not characteristic symptoms of typhoid fever. Instead, these symptoms are commonly experienced during pregnancy. Breast pain and soreness are very common in early pregnancy due to hormonal changes, and wrist pain, often due to carpal tunnel syndrome, is also prevalent in pregnancy duearchical to fluid retention. Therefore, a diagnosis of typhoid fever is highly unlikely based on the presented symptoms.",Normal physiological changes of pregnancy
doctor ive been feeling a lot of pelvic pressure lately and noticed excessive growth in some areas whats going on with my body,based on your symptoms its possible that you may have contracted trichinosis a parasitic infection caused by eating undercooked or raw pork or wild game you need to get a proper diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible,0.1695763319730758,False,False,"The patient's symptoms of 'pelvic pressure' and 'excessive growth in some areas' are inconsistent with trichinosis. Trichinosis is a parasitic infection typically presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain) followed by muscle pain, fever, and swelling, but not localized excessive growth or specific pelvic pressure. The reported symptoms strongly suggest the presence of a mass or enlargement within the pelvic region.",Uterine fibroids

Trichinosis is a systemic parasitic infection typically characterized by widespread muscle pain, tenderness, swelling (often generalized, not an isolated lump), gastrointestinal symptoms, fever, and fatigue, usually following consumption of undercooked meat. An isolated lump on the knee is not a primary or typical presentation of trichinosis, making the doctor's diagnosis highly unlikely based solely on the described symptom.",Bursitis

While shoulder swelling, neck cramps or spasms, and sharp abdominal pain can be manifestations of Trichinosis (indicating muscle inflammation and gastrointestinal involvement), the symptom of 'excessive growth' is completely inconsistent with this parasitic infection. Trichinosis is an acute to subacute infection and does not cause chronic systemic growth abnormalities. Additionally, 'bedwetting' is not a typical symptom of Trichinosis. The presence of 'excessive growth' is a significant indicator pointing towards a different underlying condition.",Gigantism

Trichinosis, a parasitic infection acquired from consuming raw or undercooked meat, typically presents with gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., diarrhea, nausea, generalized abdominal pain) followed by muscle pain, fever, and periorbital edema as the larvae migrate. Pelvic pressure and painful urination are not characteristic primary symptoms of trichinosis. Therefore, trichinosis is an unlikely diagnosis based on the reported symptoms.",Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)
doctor ive been experiencing fluid retention pain during pregnancy pain of the anus and leg cramps or spasms what could be the problem,it sounds like you may be experiencing symptoms of subacute thyroiditis this condition is an inflammation of the thyroid gland that causes pain and discomfort in the neck as well as other symptoms such as those youve described,0.2388298660516739,False,False,"The patient's symptoms, particularly 'pain of the anus,' 'fluid retention,' and 'leg cramps or spasms' during pregnancy, do not align with a diagnosis of subacute thyroiditis. Subacute thyroiditis typically presents with neck pain, thyroid tenderness, fever, and symptoms of hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism. The patient did not report neck pain, which is a hallmark symptom of subacute thyroiditis. While fluid retention and leg cramps are very common during pregnancy and can be non-specific, 'pain of the anus' is a highly specific symptom that is not explained by thyroiditis. Instead, 'pain of the anus' in pregnancy strongly suggests a localized issue such as hemorrhoids or an anal fissure.",Hemorrhoids
doctor i have been experiencing uterine contractions leg cramps or spasms spotting or bleeding during pregnancy and fluid retention can you please tell me what might be causing these symptoms,these can be symptoms of subacute thyroiditis it is caused by the inflammation of the thyroid gland which can lead to hormonal imbalances in the body,0.2413551658391952,False,False,"The patient's symptoms of uterine contractions and spotting or bleeding during pregnancy are not characteristic of subacute thyroiditis. Subacute thyroiditis typically presents with a painful, enlarged thyroid gland, fever, and symptoms related to hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism. While fluid retention can occur in hypothyroidism (a phase of subacute thyroiditis), and leg cramps can be non-specific, the core symptoms of uterine contractions and pregnancy-related bleeding are highly indicative of an obstetric complication. These symptoms strongly suggest a risk to the ongoing pregnancy.",Threatened preterm labor
doctor i am experiencing problems with movement,based on your symptom it looks like you are suffering from intracerebral hemorrhage,0.2993443012237549,False,False,"The symptom 'problems with movement' is highly non-specific and can be associated with a vast number of conditions, both neurological and non-neurological, ranging from acute events to chronic progressive disorders. While intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a severe condition that can cause acute movement problems (such as sudden weakness or paralysis), this diagnosis is usually accompanied by other specific acute symptoms like sudden onset, severe headache, altered consciousness, or specific focal neurological deficits. Without such additional, more specific information, 'problems with movement' alone does not highly suggest ICH over many other more common or less immediately life-threatening conditions. Therefore, the diagnosis is not highly suggested by the given symptom.",Parkinson's disease

Leg swelling (edema), especially in the context of a systemic inflammatory process, is highly suggestive of potential organ involvement in SLE, most commonly lupus nephritis (kidney inflammation) leading to protein loss and fluid retention. The combination of inflammatory arthritis and edema strongly points towards a systemic autoimmune disease like SLE, making the doctor's diagnosis a highly plausible and appropriate assessment.",systemic lupus erythematosis sle
doctor i have been experiencing a dry and flaky scalp also i have noticed that i havent grown in height in a long time what could be the reason,the symptoms you have described could be due to premature ovarian failure,0.2845524549484253,False,False,"The symptoms provided do not highly suggest premature ovarian failure. 'Dry and flaky scalp' is a common dermatological issue and not specific to premature ovarian failure. More significantly, 'haven't grown in height in a long time' indicates a growth disturbance, which is not a direct symptom of premature ovarian failure. Premature ovarian failure primarily affects reproductive hormones and fertility, causing symptoms like irregular periods, hot flashes, and vaginal dryness, typically in women approaching or in their reproductive years, not primarily growth stunting. A more likely diagnosis for both stunted growth and dry skin/scalp is hypothyroidism, especially if the patient is still within an age where growth is expected.",Hypothyroidism
doctor i am having black tarry stools and i am really worried about it,it sounds like you are experiencing a condition called melena this can be caused by several factors one of which is a folate deficiency in your body,0.2705834507942199,False,False,"Black tarry stools are indeed characteristic of melena, which indicates upper gastrointestinal bleeding. While the symptom description (melena) is correctly identified, the suggested cause, 'folate deficiency,' is medically inaccurate. Folate deficiency leads to megaloblastic anemia and does not directly cause gastrointestinal bleeding or melena. Upper GI bleeding, leading to melena, is most commonly caused by conditions such as peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, or esophageal varices.",Melena due to Peptic Ulcer Disease
doctor ive been having difficulty breathing as well as nausea and sharp chest pain i also noticed my feet and legs are quite swollen,it sounds like you might be experiencing fluid overload,0.2948927879333496,False,False,"While difficulty breathing, nausea, and swollen feet and legs are consistent with fluid overload (often secondary to conditions like heart failure), the symptom of 'sharp chest pain' is not typically a direct manifestation of fluid overload itself. Fluid overload often causes a feeling of pressure or tightness in the chest due to pulmonary congestion, but 'sharp' pain suggests a different underlying pathology, such as pleuritic pain, cardiac ischemia, or a pulmonary event. The combination of difficulty breathing, sharp chest pain, and leg swelling (which can indicate deep vein thrombosis) raises a strong suspicion for Pulmonary Embolism, which better explains all presented symptoms concurrently.",Pulmonary Embolism
doctor i have swollen lymph nodes and i am a bit worried about it,do you have any dental painpatient yes i have been experiencing dental pain for a few days now,0.2124567776918411,False,True,"Swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), particularly in the head and neck region, are a common physiological response to local infection or inflammation. Dental infections, such as an abscess or severe periodontitis, are a very frequent cause of reactive lymphadenopathy in the submandibular, submental, or cervical lymph nodes. The doctor's direct question about dental pain, followed by the patient's affirmative response, strongly supports the diagnosis of a dental infection as the cause for the swollen lymph nodes.","Dental infection (e.g., dental abscess, periodontitis)"

While coughing can be associated with allergies (e.g., due to post-nasal drip or allergic asthma), peripheral edema strongly suggests systemic fluid retention, often indicative of underlying cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic issues. A more fitting diagnosis for the combination of peripheral edema and coughing, particularly if the cough is persistent and non-productive or productive of frothy sputum, would be a condition like Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), where the heart's inability to pump efficiently leads to fluid backup in the extremities and lungs.",Congestive Heart Failure
doctor i have been experiencing burning abdominal pain what could be the reason behind it,based on your symptom it seems like you might be having a sickle cell crisis you need to get some tests done to confirm it,0.2456220239400863,False,False,"Burning abdominal pain, while a form of abdominal discomfort, is not a typical primary descriptor for a sickle cell crisis. Sickle cell crises usually involve severe, acute, and often throbbing or sharp pain due to vaso-occlusion, which can affect the abdomen. However, the specific descriptor 'burning' strongly suggests conditions related to acid irritation or inflammation of the gastrointestinal lining, such as gastritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or peptic ulcer disease. Without a known history of sickle cell disease or other associated symptoms like jaundice, anemia, or prior crises, a sickle cell crisis is not the most direct or likely diagnosis based solely on 'burning abdominal pain.'",Peptic Ulcer Disease

The provided patient symptoms, 'burning abdominal pain that just won't go away', do not include any information about the patient's medical history, specifically whether they have sickle cell disease. While severe abdominal pain can be a symptom of a vaso-occlusive crisis in a patient with Sickle Cell Disease, these symptoms alone, without that crucial context, are non-specific and do not highly suggest a sickle cell crisis. Burning abdominal pain is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal conditions in the general population.",Peptic Ulcer Disease
doctor i have been experiencing low back pain lately what could be the cause,it could be due to hydatidiform mole which is a rare pregnancy complication have you experienced any abnormal vaginal bleeding or passed grapelike cystsnote hydatidiform mole can also cause vaginal bleeding and grapelike cysts to pass through the vagina,0.2071073651313781,False,False,"The patient's sole symptom is 'low back pain lately'. Hydatidiform mole, a rare pregnancy complication, primarily presents with symptoms such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, severe nausea and vomiting, rapid uterine enlargement, and passage of grape-like cysts. Low back pain is a very non-specific symptom and is not a characteristic or primary indicator for hydatidiform mole. Therefore, diagnosing hydatidiform mole based solely on low back pain is highly unlikely and medically unsound without additional specific symptoms.",Lumbosacral strain
doctor i have a swelling on my leg and my eye is swollen too,it seems like you have been bitten by an insect,0.2378009110689163,False,False,"While an insect bite can cause localized swelling on the leg or eye, the presence of swelling in two distinct and distant areas simultaneously (leg and eye) is less likely to be due to two separate, unrelated insect bites. It more strongly suggests a systemic reaction or a generalized condition affecting multiple body parts. An allergic reaction (e.g., angioedema) is a more probable explanation for concurrent swelling in multiple areas.","Allergic reaction (e.g., Angioedema)"
doctor i have been feeling ill lately,it could be due to your connective tissue disorder,0.2635771036148071,False,False,"The symptom 'feeling ill lately' is highly non-specific and can be associated with a vast number of conditions, ranging from minor acute illnesses to chronic systemic disorders.
